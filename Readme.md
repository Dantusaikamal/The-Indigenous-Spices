# The Indigeneous Spices

The Indigeneous Spices is a website targetted to bring the authentic spice vendors online through an e-commerce website.

## Goals

We are following Agile Software Development approach for our project.

The steps involved are:

**1. Requirements:**
   
   Plan the requirements for the website. Everything required such as a user-friendly webpage, a payment gateway, a Sign-in page, 
   a back-end server, etc must be properly before hand. A decent amount of time must be spent on planning the webpage properly.
   
**2. Design:**
   
   Before we start creating the webpage, we have to again plan the design of the webpage. For example, 
   What colours should the website mainly have?
   Which position should the navigator bar be placed?
   What fonts should we use?
   What will be the logo and title for the webpage?

**3. Development:**

   Development is the process of building the website. We need to write the code required to meet the needs of the Design planned earlier.
   The developers will work together to create the webpage, add a cloud based server, a payment gateway and everthing else required. The developers
   will try to ensure the testers won't find any bugs.

**4. Testing:**

   The testing team will try to exploit the webpage in all the possible ways. Every bug found will be fixed by the developers once again. The developers
   can be divided into two teams: One will focus on the pending tasks and one will try to solve the bugs reported. The testing will be done throughout the
   process starting from the initial release till deployment and later on.

**5. Deployement:**
   
   After intense testing by the testing team from the local host, the release will be deployed to a domain based host. The testing will be carried out again
   to ensure the proper fuctioning of the webpage.

**6. Review:**
   
   The webpage will be reviewed from time to time. New features will be proposed, changes will be made to the earlier release and then the process starts from 
   the beginning once again to add the required changes.
